Notes on the SCFI testsuite in GAS:

* At this time, SCFI machinery is only supported for x86_64.

* When adding more tests, please keep CFI annotations updated in the .s files.
  Recall that user-specified, synthesizable CFI annotations are ignored by the
  GAS when --scfi (=all) is in effect.  Adding CFI annocations, irrespectively,
  makes the testcases clearer in terms of understanding the expected unwind
  data.  The only excpetion to this guideline is the following item below.

* Note that GAS issues a warning:
    "Warning: --scfi=all ignores .cfi_startproc and other sythesizable CFI
    directives"
  when it encounters CFI directives in the input assembly and --scfi (=all) is
  active.  To bypass the noise from this warning, while keeping the testcases
  useful/understandable, the following CFI annotations are kept commented out:
      #	      .cfi_startproc
      ...
      #       .cfi_endproc
